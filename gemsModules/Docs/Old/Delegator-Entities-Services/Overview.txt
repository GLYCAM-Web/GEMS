This file contains overview information regarding the Delegator module
in the gemsModules.

The contents of this file are likely to change often for the time being
because this is still in active development.

The main players are:

Delegator :  A module that takes in a JSON object containing a request
             and then tries to figure out how to do whatever is in the
             request.  Of course, the request has a rigid format.

Entity    :  This is an object that might be built or used or modified
             within the context of the JSON object's request.  

             Examples:  Sequence, PDB File, Glycoprotein, DB Query

             Note that the Delegator itself is an Entity.

             Entities can contain other Entities.

Service   :  Something that an Entity might do, such as build or modify.

             A Service can contain Entities and other Services.  

             A Service might also contain Actions.

Action    :  This is a bit like a service, but is more of a sub-task.
             For example, validating an incoming JSON object is an
             Action.  Another action might be checking to see if a
             Sequence contains residues that are known by the GMML
             Metadata.  This Action would be part of a Validation 
             Service.  That is, these are parts of Services, but are
             not something a user might think of as a Service.  The
             distinction is imperfect and a bit semantic.

Common    :  This module holds all the "common services".  These are
             the Actions and Services that all of the Entities, and 
             some of the Services, need to perform.
