This file contains a summary of the changes I made to print statements in the
past couple days.  I commented out a bunch and removed others.  This is 
because stdout needs to be reserved for a JSON object only during normal
operations.  We will probably start using Pythons logging soon.

This file is merely for convenience and can be safely removed once folks have 
a chance to be sure that I didn't break anything.  

   * This summary does not concern itself with 'test', 'temp' and similar files.

   * It also does not concern itself with the behavior of 'main' functions.


batchcompute:  Not worrying about because still has a long way to go.
               There are many print statements

common:        Should be all wrapped or commented, but will need to be retooled once we decide on logging. 

conjugate:     All looks good.

delegator:     Should be all wrapped or commented, but will need to be retooled once we decide on logging. 

graph:         All commented out.

query:         All commented out.  MIGHT NEED INSPECTION.

sequence:      All commented out.  MIGHT NEED INSPECTION.

status:        All commented out.  MIGHT NEED INSPECTION.
