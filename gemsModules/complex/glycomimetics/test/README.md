How to run this test:
/home/yao/Documents/GLYCAM_Dev_Env/V_2/Web_Programs/gems/gemsModules/complex/glycomimetics/tasks/external_scripts_bash/master_submit.sh /home/yao/Documents/GLYCAM_Dev_Env/V_2/Web_Programs/gems/gemsModules/complex/glycomimetics/test/example_flu_3ubq_aldehyde_library

(Essentially it is: "master_submit.sh job_directory". Run from whereever most convenient for you. You don't have to provide absolute paths.)
