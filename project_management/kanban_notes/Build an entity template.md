Just before 2 AM, I copied the mmservice/mdaas directory to a directory called TEMPLATE.  Then, I opened Obsidian so I could take notes.

I'm going to see how long it takes to turn the MDaaS folder into a TEMPLATE folder, by hand.  I'll only use shortcuts I know from VIM to do it.  I won't test it tonight.  I'll just time how long it takes to do whatever I think is realistic for making a template.

It's 1:59 AM and I'm starting now.

At 2:39 I had finished a first pass at generating a template entity from an existing one.

40 minutes, doing it all by hand.  And, it's easily scriptable.  

Cookiecutter is looking good for this. 
DEFINITELY look into Jinja
Leaning more toward Cookiecutter, but need to learn more.
