Currently working on this workflow:
- [x] Entity receives incoming JSON string
- [x] Entity transforms it into a transaction
- [x] Transaction translates top-level directives into Entity's Procedural Options
- [x] Receiver hands transaction off to transaction manager
- [x] Transaction manager passes Entity portion of transaction to the  Request Manager
- [x] Request manager extracts all explicit services into an AAOP list 
	- [x] DRAFTED
- [x] Request manager collapses all unknown services into an error service 
	- [x] DRAFTED
- [x] Request manager sends the Entity info to each Service's implied service manager 
	- [x] draft in flux
- [ ] Implied Services Manager inspects the requested services, the inputs, and the Procedural Options.  From these, the Service generates a list of all service requests that are implied and packs them into a list of AAOPs 
	- [ ] prior code exists, needs to be moved / rewritten / expanded /wrapped
- [ ] Implied Service Manager then generates a list of pre-requisite service requests, if any.  This step considers only service needs provided by the current entity - services requested from other entities get handled down in the tasks.
	- [ ] some settings info exists somewhere 
- [x] Implied servicecs manager returns the AAOP list to the Request Manager 
- [ ] The request manager collects all the resulting service requests 
- [ ] Request Manager sends them back to the services for a merge of any duplicates.
- [ ] During merges, the service inspects the multiple service requests.  Based on its rules for service requests, it might merge some (or all), might keep them all as individual services, or it might return a special "error" service request that contains options to be later turned into Notices.
	- [ ] This is gonna be a hack for now
- [ ] Service returns the resulting AAOP list.
- [ ] Request manager sends the AAOP list and Project info to each Service.
- [ ] Each Service fills in each service_request with all the information that the service request needs.
- [ ] The AAOP list is returned to Request manager.
- [ ] Request manager collects together all the AAOP lists from the Services into a single list.
- [x] Request manager returns AAOP request list to the transaction manager 
- [x] Transaction manager sends the AAOP list to the AAOP Tree Manager.  
- [ ] AAOP Tree Manager arranges AAOP objects into an AAOP Tree and instantiates an AAOP Tree Pair object.
- [x] AAOP Tree manager returns Tree Pair to transaction manager.
- [ ] Transaction manager sends Tree Pair to Servicer.
- [ ] Servicer runs services and collects responses
- [ ] Servicer returns Tree Pair to transaction manager
- [ ] Transaction manager sends Tree Pair to the response manager
- [ ] Response manager instantiates an Entity to be returned.
- [ ] Response manager generates list of services that were actually run and puts that info into its return entity.
	- [ ] Note that "error requests" are not added to this list.   They are returned as responses only.
- [ ] Response manager adds the list of responses - including error responses - to the return entity.
- [ ] Response manager adds top-level outputs and notices, as needed, to the return entity.
- [x] Response manager returns entity to transaction manager.
- [x] Transaction manager sends Project and outgoing entity to Project manager.
- [ ] Project manager instantiates a new project, generates whatever outgoing project info is needed, 
- [x] Project manager returns the project to transaction manager.
- [x] Transaction manager returns the transaction.
- [ ] 

This old list is probably redundant, but check it:

- [ ] Finish writing the code for managing delegator's services 
	- [x] Write all the tasks that are needed
	- [ ] Write mechanism for each service to perform each task in order
	- [ ] Write mechanism for services to be performed in order
	- [ ] Refine and expand mechanism for converting top-level input into service requests
	- [ ] Write mechanism for converting service responses into top-level output
