### RunMD

This first version is going to be an enormous hack.  Apologies in advance to whoever needs to clean up after me.

All of this code exists in some way or another.   I just need to hack it together for this very specific purpose.

- [x] Assign working directory naming needs to happen higher up
- [x] Ensure that the input files exist in the expected location
- [x] Generate an output (working) directory
- [x] Copy the input files to the output directory
- [x] Copy the MD files to the output directory
- [x] Have the amber entity do what it needs to do
- [x] I think the following part needs to be a daemon>
	- [x] Have batchcompute and/or batchcompute/slurm generate input files
	- [x] I think the submission happens automatically
- [x] Collect and send back the response
