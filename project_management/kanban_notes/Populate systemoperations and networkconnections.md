Move appropriate code to systemoperations and networkconnections as is appropriate.

systemoperations - ops that involve the operating system, e.g., copying files, detecting environment variables.

networkconnections - ops that involve networking, either inside the current system or to other computers.  Notably, generic gRPC-related tasks should go here.
