TEST WORKFLOW IS: Yes
TEST WORKFLOW STEPS IS: 1
Beginning MD simulations on Wed Oct 23 01:05:38 EDT 2024
Working directory is /website/TESTS/git-ignore-me/pre-push/sequence/cb/Builds/f2bdcfc5-cfb4-40fa-94bf-5ba06dffea4b/New_Builds/structure 
Using info from file: 'Run-Gas-Min-Parameters.bash'. 
Notice: The environment defines AMBERHOME as: /programs/amber

This script will use the following as AMBERHOME:
AMBERHOME = /programs/amber


AMBERHOME/amber.sh was sourced.  
The output is between the two following strings of '=' signs:
===============================================================

===============================================================


There will be 1 phases to this simulation: 

Phase 1 
	- is called min 
	- has prefix min-gas 
	- is described as: Minimize gas-phase structure, dielectric=80

	Starting phase min

		The command is:
		sander -O   -i min-gas.in  -o min-gas.o  -e min-gas.en  -p unminimized-gas.parm7  -c unminimized-gas.rst7  -r min-gas.restrt.nc  -x min-gas.nc  -inf min-gas.info 

		
Phase min finished normally after 0m 0s.
Simulation finished normally.
