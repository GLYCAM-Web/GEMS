2.  Saccharide molecules detected
===========================================

This section contains the list of saccharide molecules that were found.  They 
are given in glycam condensed notation.  For each linkage in an oligosaccharide, 
the identity of the inter-residue linking atom is also given.  For complete 
details about the saccharide residues in the molecules, see section 3.

Linking atoms, where relevant, are identified by:
        Linkage Index
        Chain ID
        Residue Name
        Residue Number
        Atom Name

12 saccharide molecule(s) were detected:

3.  Saccharide residues detected
===========================================

The following is a list of all saccharide residues found in the file.  Most of
them will also be contained in the list of oligosaccharides above.

The identity of the ring oxygen for each residue is also given.
Ring oxygens are identified by:
        Atom Name
        Serial
        Residue Name
        Chain ID
        Residue Serial
        Alternate Location
        Insertion Code
