Beginning MD simulations on Tue Apr 18 03:59:31 EDT 2023
Working directory is /website/userdata/sequence/cb/Builds/f86b075b-a9cc-465e-bc7a-512004946bbc/New_Builds/structure
Using info from file: 'Gas-Min-Parameters.bash'. 

The mdEngine is sander and the text to check for success is 'wallclock() was called'.
Complete mdEngine command is 'sander'.

There will be 1 phases to this simulation:

Phase 1 has prefix min-gas and is described as: Gas-phase minimization

	Starting phase 1

		The command is:
		sander  -i min-gas.in  -o min-gas.o  -e min-gas.en  -p unminimized-gas.parm7  -c unminimized-gas.rst7  -r min-gas.restrt.nc  -x min-gas.nc  -inf min-gas.info  -ref unminimized-gas.rst7
